Rock Paper Scissors

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game. The game was written given this user input example:

>$ruby rps.rb favorite

>You are playing against strategy 'favorite'.

>Type 'r', 'p' or 's'.

>r

>I chose 's'. You win!

>you won 1 times.

>you lost 0 times.

>we tied 0 times.

>Type 'r', 'p' or 's'.

>p

>I chose 'p'. It's a tie!

>you won 1 times.

>you lost 0 times.

>we tied 1 times.


To start the game follow these instructions:

1. Use Ruby 2.3

2. Download the repo

3. ruby rps.rb


To exit the game type 'exit'

Computer Strategy 1: Beat Their Last Move.

Here you will play the move that beats their last move.

Computer Strategy 2: Beat Their Favorite.

Here you will play the move that beats their most frequent move.

Computer Strategy 3: Extra Credit. Random moves

Randomized computer moves to keep you guessing!

BONUS - When the game is started the computer randomly selects a strategy from the 3 above and implements it throughout the time the game is played. This challenges the player to figure out the strategy first. Then focus on winning the game!

The program will announce the strategy to the user upon entering exiting the program.

Future plans = This was made in approximately 4 hours. If I had more time, I would re-factor some of the methods to remove some of the smelly code. I would also segment the implementation of the player input, game play logic, and messaging into separate classes for easier additions/building.
